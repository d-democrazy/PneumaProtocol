## Reimagining Blockchain Value Distribution Through Gas-Based Consensus

*Version 2.0 | July 2025*

---

## Executive Summary

Pneuma Protocol introduces a revolutionary approach to blockchain economics by transforming gas consumption into a measurable form of network contribution. Instead of relying on fiat-pegged stablecoins as value anchors, the protocol establishes PNEUMA as a native blockchain value parameter, creating a self-contained economic system where utility directly drives value.

The protocol operates on Core Blockchain with a fixed supply of 2.1 billion PNEUMA tokens, distributed exclusively to wallet addresses over a century-long timeline through 25 deflationary epochs. Through innovative mechanics including dual-weighted scoring, soul-bound identity validation, and lifetime score accumulation, Pneuma Protocol creates a sustainable economic model that rewards genuine network participation.

**Key Innovation**: PNEUMA tokens serve as both reward instruments for network contributors and value reference parameters for ecosystem token valuation, creating a unified economic system that prevents hyperinflation while enabling meaningful value creation.

## The Problem: Current Limitations of Crypto Economics

Today's cryptocurrency ecosystem faces fundamental structural challenges that limit its potential for creating sustainable value. The widespread reliance on fiat-pegged stablecoins as value anchors creates an inherent dependency on traditional financial systems, undermining the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology. This dependency manifests in several critical ways.

Current decentralized finance systems treat tokens as either valuable or worthless based primarily on market speculation rather than actual utility. The prevalence of terms like "shitcoin" and "rug pull" reflects a market dynamic where value attribution lacks systematic foundation. Projects can launch tokens with minimal real-world utility, leading to unsustainable economic models that benefit early speculators rather than genuine contributors to network growth.

The existing reward distribution mechanisms in most blockchain protocols favor passive holding over active participation. Traditional staking models reward users for locking tokens without requiring meaningful contribution to network utility. This creates economic incentives that prioritize capital accumulation over genuine ecosystem development, leading to wealth concentration and reduced network effects.

Furthermore, the current approach to token valuation relies heavily on external market forces and speculative trading rather than intrinsic utility metrics. This disconnect between token value and actual network contribution creates volatile market conditions that discourage long-term thinking and sustainable project development.

## The Pneuma Solution: Gas as Network Mining

Pneuma Protocol fundamentally reimagines blockchain economics by treating gas consumption as a form of network mining activity. This paradigm shift draws inspiration from Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus mechanism, where computational power secures the network and receives rewards. In Pneuma Protocol, gas expenditure represents productive network contribution, creating a direct relationship between utility and value.

The protocol establishes PNEUMA as a native value parameter that serves dual purposes: it acts as a reward token for network contributors and as a mathematical reference for ecosystem token valuation. This dual functionality creates a self-contained economic system that operates independently of external market forces while maintaining mathematical stability through fixed supply constraints.

The gas-based consensus mechanism captures both direct and indirect network participation through a sophisticated scoring system. When users pay gas fees for transactions, they receive full credit (100% weight) in the scoring calculation. When they participate in transactions initiated by others, they receive partial credit (25% weight), recognizing their role as network infrastructure participants. This dual-weight system ensures that both active users and network service providers receive appropriate rewards for their contributions.

The protocol's approach to identity verification through SoulBoundTokens creates a unique mapping between wallet addresses and ecosystem participation. Each wallet address must mint exactly one non-transferable SoulBoundToken to participate in the reward system. This design prevents Sybil attacks while ensuring that rewards flow to genuine participants rather than automated farming operations.

## Dual-Weighted Scoring System: Capturing Network Contribution

Pneuma Protocol implements a sophisticated scoring mechanism that captures both direct and indirect forms of network participation. This dual-weighted system ensures that all forms of meaningful contribution receive appropriate recognition while preventing gaming and maintaining fairness across different participation patterns.

### Scoring Components

The scoring calculation operates on two fundamental components:

1. **TxnFeePaid**: Gas fees paid by a wallet for transactions it initiates, receiving full weight (100%) in the scoring calculation
2. **TxnFeeInvolved**: Gas fees from transactions where the wallet serves as a recipient or participant in activities initiated by others, receiving partial weight (25%)


### Complete Scoring Formula

$$\text{Score} = \text{TxnFeePaid} + (0.25 \times \text{TxnFeeInvolved})$$

This mathematical relationship ensures that active participants receive maximum benefit while still rewarding wallets that provide essential network services such as liquidity provision, contract interaction endpoints, and transaction facilitation.

The lifetime accumulation mechanism means that scores compound over time rather than resetting with each epoch. A wallet that participates consistently from Epoch 1 through Epoch 25 will have accumulated scores from all network activity during that period, creating natural advantages for sustained participation while still allowing new entrants to achieve meaningful rewards through high activity levels.

This scoring system creates several important economic dynamics. It incentivizes genuine network usage over passive holding, rewards both active users and service providers appropriately, prevents Sybil attacks through the one-to-one SoulBoundToken mapping, and creates compound advantages for consistent long-term participation.

The dual-weighted approach also enables the protocol to capture the full spectrum of network contribution patterns. Day traders who frequently initiate transactions receive high TxnFeePaid scores. Liquidity providers and contract endpoints receive steady TxnFeeInvolved scores. Most participants engage in both activities, creating balanced score accumulation that reflects their total network contribution.

## Core Architecture: Six Interconnected Applications

Pneuma Protocol operates through six core applications that work together to create a comprehensive economic ecosystem. Each application serves a specific function while contributing to the overall system's stability and growth potential.

**GasScoring** serves as the foundation layer, continuously monitoring blockchain activity and calculating contribution scores for all participants. This service integrates with Core Blockchain's infrastructure to capture real-time transaction data, implementing the dual-weighted scoring mechanism where outgoing transactions receive 100% weight and incoming transactions receive 25% weight. The scoring system maintains lifetime accumulation, ensuring that participant contributions compound over time rather than resetting with each epoch.

**RewardCalc** functions as the economic engine, calculating reward distributions based on accumulated scores and current epoch parameters. This application implements the century-long distribution timeline with 25 four-year epochs, each receiving 10% fewer tokens than the previous epoch. The continuous accrual system allows participants to claim rewards at their discretion while maintaining mathematical precision in individual allocations based on their proportional share of total network scores.

**SoulBoundToken** provides the identity and validation layer, ensuring that each participant maintains a unique identity within the ecosystem. These non-transferable tokens serve as virtual mining licenses, enabling score accumulation and reward eligibility. The one-to-one mapping between wallet addresses and SoulBoundTokens creates a robust foundation for preventing gaming and ensuring fair distribution across the participant base.

**PneumaToken** manages the token distribution mechanism, ensuring that PNEUMA tokens flow exclusively to wallet addresses based on their accumulated scores. The token contract implements the deflationary epoch allocation system, automatically calculating and distributing rewards according to the mathematical framework.
There is no transfer function for PNEUMA token. It is neither monetary instrument nor tradeable aset. It is meant to be stable parameter reference, and physically it is to be collateral to unlock new system.

**LaunchPad** orchestrates the project onboarding process, enabling new tokens to enter the ecosystem with PNEUMA-based valuation references. Projects demonstrate real utility through their contract activity, which generates scores that contribute to their token valuation growth. The platform requires projects to implement standardized interfaces that enable proper score tracking and valuation calculation.

**DEX** facilitates token trading using PNEUMA-derived valuations as pricing references rather than traditional market-making mechanisms. Trading pairs operate using mathematical calculations based on token valuations relative to PNEUMA, creating consistent pricing across the ecosystem. This approach enables direct token-to-token trading while maintaining system-wide price stability.

## Tokenomics: The Deflationary Distribution Model

The protocol's economic sustainability depends on a carefully designed mathematical framework that prevents hyperinflation while ensuring meaningful reward distribution over a century-long timeline. The Deflationary Distribution Model divides the 2.1 billion PNEUMA supply across 25 epochs with progressively decreasing allocations.

### 1. Deflationary Allocation Parameters

Let:
- $S_{\text{total}} = 2{,}100{,}000{,}000$ PNEUMA (total supply)
- $N = 25$ epochs
- $r = 0.90$ (deflation rate per epoch; 10% drop each epoch)

The initial epoch allocation is calculated using geometric series to ensure complete distribution of the total supply:

$$S_1 = \frac{S_{\text{total}}(1 - r)}{1 - r^N} \approx 226{,}000{,}000 \text{ PNEUMA}$$

This represents approximately 10.76% of the total supply allocated to the first epoch.

### 2. Epoch Allocation Formula

Each subsequent epoch receives exactly 90% of the previous epoch's allocation:

$$S_i = S_1 \times r^{i-1}$$

where $i$ represents the epoch number. This progression ensures:
- Epoch 1: ~226 million tokens
- Epoch 2: ~203.6 million tokens  
- Epoch 3: ~183.26 million tokens
- ...
- Epoch 25: ~18.07 million tokens

### 3. Individual Reward Calculation

Each participant's reward for epoch $i$ is calculated as:

$${Reward}_{j,i} = \frac{\text{Score}_{j,i}}{\sum_{k} \text{Score}_{k,i}} \times S_i$$

where:
- $\text{Score}_{j,i}$ represents the cumulative lifetime score of participant $j$ at the end of epoch $i$
- $\sum_{k} \text{Score}_{k,i}$ represents the total network score at that time

The scoring mechanism implements lifetime accumulation rather than epoch-based resets. This means that participants who join in Epoch 1 accumulate scores across all 25 epochs, creating compound advantages for consistent participation. New participants can still achieve significant rewards through high activity levels, but the mathematical framework naturally rewards long-term commitment to the ecosystem.

This mathematical structure ensures that the total ecosystem never exceeds 2.1 billion PNEUMA tokens, preventing infinite inflation while allowing meaningful reward distribution that incentivizes both early participation and ongoing contribution. The balance between deflationary pressure and accumulated scoring creates economic incentives for sustained network development.

## Reward Distribution: Century-Long Economic Timeline

Pneuma Protocol implements a sophisticated reward distribution mechanism designed to operate over a century-long timeline, ensuring sustainable incentives for network participation across multiple generations of users and developers. The system divides this timeline into twenty-five four-year epochs, each with progressively smaller reward allocations.

### Epoch Structure

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Total Supply | 2,100,000,000 PNEUMA |
| Epochs | 25 |
| Epoch Duration | 4 years each |
| Deflation Rate | 10% per epoch ($r = 0.90$) |
| Initial Allocation | ~226,000,000 PNEUMA (≈10.76%) |

The first epoch begins with approximately 226 million PNEUMA tokens available for distribution, representing 10.76% of the total supply. Each subsequent epoch receives exactly 10% fewer tokens than the previous epoch, creating what the protocol terms "ultrasound deflation." This progressive reduction ensures that early participants receive higher absolute rewards while maintaining meaningful incentive structures for future generations.

### Example Reward Calculation

Consider a scenario where:
- Epoch 1 allocation: 226,000,000 PNEUMA
- User Score: 1,000
- Total network Score: 100,000

$$\text{Reward} = \frac{1{,}000}{100{,}000} \times 226{,}000{,}000 = 2{,}260{,}000 \text{ PNEUMA}$$

The mathematical progression ensures complete distribution of the 2.1 billion token supply across all 25 epochs. The geometric series formula guarantees that no tokens remain undistributed while creating natural scarcity that increases the value of rewards over time. This approach differs from traditional inflation models by ensuring finite supply while maintaining perpetual distribution incentives.

Individual reward calculations operate continuously rather than in discrete batches. Each participant's reward share is calculated based on their cumulative lifetime score divided by the total network score at the time of each epoch's conclusion. This proportional distribution ensures that rewards scale directly with network contribution rather than capital holdings or arbitrary lockup periods.

The continuous accrual system provides several advantages over traditional staking models. Participants can claim rewards at their discretion rather than being forced into predetermined schedules. The system maintains mathematical precision in reward calculations regardless of claiming frequency. Most importantly, rewards are directly proportional to network contribution rather than passive token holding, creating incentives for genuine utility development.

The century-long timeline serves multiple economic functions. It provides long-term sustainability by ensuring that reward distributions continue far into the future, creating predictable economic models that enable strategic planning for projects and participants. It establishes clear incentives for early participation while maintaining engagement mechanisms for future generations who will inherit and develop the ecosystem.

The epoch system also creates natural checkpoints for protocol evolution and community governance. Each four-year period allows for meaningful technological development and community growth while maintaining consistent economic incentives. The progressive reduction in epoch allocations creates increasing scarcity that naturally drives value appreciation for all participants.

## Token Valuation: PNEUMA as Universal Reference

The protocol's approach to token valuation represents a fundamental departure from traditional market-based pricing mechanisms. Rather than relying on speculative trading or external market forces, Pneuma Protocol establishes PNEUMA as a universal value reference that enables mathematical calculation of token valuations based on actual network contribution and utility.

PNEUMA serves as both a reward token for network participants and a value reference parameter for ecosystem token pricing. This dual functionality creates a unified economic system where all value calculations derive from the same mathematical foundation, preventing arbitrage opportunities and ensuring consistent pricing relationships across the entire ecosystem.

For launched projects, token valuation operates through contract score accumulation. Each deployed contract accumulates scores based on the gas consumption it generates through user interactions. These contract scores serve as growth parameters that contribute to the token's overall valuation in PNEUMA terms. Projects that generate more network activity achieve higher valuations, creating direct alignment between utility and value.

### Exchange Rate Calculation

When trading Token A for Token B, the exchange rate is calculated as:

$$\text{Exchange Rate} = \frac{\text{Token A Valuation in PNEUMA}}{\text{Token B Valuation in PNEUMA}}$$

The token valuation calculation combines base value components with growth components. Base value represents the fundamental backing that ensures all tokens maintain minimum economic substance. Growth components reflect the actual network contribution and utility generation that projects provide to the ecosystem. This dual-component approach prevents worthless tokens while enabling unlimited growth potential for genuinely useful projects.

The centralized oracle system provides real-time price discovery by continuously calculating token valuations based on accumulated contract scores and network activity. This oracle serves as the single source of truth for all token values, updating prices immediately when contract scores change or when new network activity occurs. The mathematical precision of this system eliminates the price manipulation opportunities that plague traditional trading systems.

Exchange rate calculations operate through direct mathematical relationships rather than market-based price discovery. This approach ensures consistent pricing across all trading pairs while eliminating the need for intermediary currencies or complex liquidity pool management.

The absence of PNEUMA trading pairs is crucial for maintaining system stability. PNEUMA serves purely as a value reference parameter, never entering trading pools directly. This design prevents the price manipulation that affects traditional governance tokens while ensuring that PNEUMA maintains its role as a stable mathematical anchor for ecosystem valuation.

## Project Onboarding: Utility-Driven Token Generation

The LaunchPad platform implements a comprehensive project onboarding system that prioritizes genuine utility creation over speculative token launches. This system ensures that new tokens enter the ecosystem with clear value propositions and mathematical foundations for sustainable growth.

Project registration requires adherence to specific interface standards that enable proper score tracking and valuation calculation. Projects must deploy contracts that implement standardized event logging for gas consumption tracking, user interaction monitoring, and network contribution measurement. These technical requirements ensure that all launched projects can participate in the score-based valuation system.

The utility verification process focuses on measuring actual network contribution rather than subjective assessments of project quality. Projects demonstrate value through their ability to generate sustained user activity, create network effects that benefit other ecosystem participants, and contribute to overall network growth through increased gas consumption and transaction volume.

Contract score accumulation begins immediately upon project deployment, with scores contributing to token valuation growth over time. Projects that successfully attract users and generate sustained activity will see their token valuations increase proportionally to their network contribution. This creates natural market dynamics where successful projects achieve higher valuations while unsuccessful projects remain at baseline levels.

The token generation process operates through standardized deployment templates that ensure compatibility with the ecosystem's scoring and valuation systems. Projects receive technical documentation and development tools that simplify the integration process while maintaining the security and standardization requirements necessary for ecosystem participation.

Quality incentives emerge naturally from the mathematical structure rather than subjective curation processes. Projects that solve real problems and generate genuine user engagement will accumulate higher contract scores, leading to token appreciation that benefits all stakeholders. Conversely, projects that fail to create meaningful utility will struggle to achieve significant valuations, protecting the ecosystem from speculative launches.

The LaunchPad also provides ongoing support for project development through technical resources, community engagement tools, and integration assistance. This comprehensive approach ensures that launched projects have the resources necessary to achieve sustainable growth while maintaining the quality standards required for ecosystem participation.

## Long-term Sustainability

Pneuma Protocol implements comprehensive security mechanisms designed to protect the ecosystem from various attack vectors while maintaining operational flexibility for legitimate participants. These security measures operate at multiple levels, from individual transaction validation to system-wide economic safeguards.

To ensure transparency, trustlessness, and verifiability over the century‑long incentive schedule, Pneuma Protocol leverages an on‑chain Oracle contract as the single source of truth for all score and allocation data. Pneuma Protocol guarantees that every participant’s score—and thus their share of epoch allocations—can be independently verified and cannot be tampered with.

The SoulBoundToken system provides fundamental protection against Sybil attacks by requiring each wallet address to mint exactly one non-transferable identity token. This requirement creates economic friction for attackers attempting to game the system through multiple addresses while imposing minimal costs on legitimate participants. The one-to-one mapping between addresses and identity tokens ensures that rewards flow to genuine contributors rather than automated farming operations.

The dual-weighted scoring system includes built-in protection against gaming attempts. The 25% weight for TxnFeeInvolved prevents passive farming strategies where attackers attempt to generate artificial transaction volume without genuine network contribution. The full weight for TxnFeePaid ensures that genuine users receive appropriate rewards for their direct participation.

The mathematical constraints built into the reward distribution system provide inherent protection against various economic attacks. The fixed 2.1 billion token supply prevents infinite inflation regardless of network activity levels. The deflationary epoch allocation ensures that reward rates decrease over time, preventing long-term sustainability issues. The proportional distribution mechanism ensures that no single participant can monopolize rewards without corresponding network contribution.
